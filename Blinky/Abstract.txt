The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for NXP Kinetis 'MK64' series using
NXP 'FRDM-K64F' evaluation board populated with the 'K64FN1M0VLL12' device.
Compliant to the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS)

Example functionality
 - Clock Settings: Core clock = 120 MHz
 - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - RGB LEDs are blinking with speed depending on SysTick timer interrupt period


The Blinky program is available in different targets:
   CMSIS-DAP:                      Debug/Target Driver is configured as CMSIS-DAP
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)
   ULINK2:                         Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK2
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

Selecting "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDAv2 application:
 1. Download and install the mbed OpenSDAv2 USB Drivers found at http://mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration
 2. Start OpenSDAv2 in bootloader mode: Unplug and plug the OpenSDAv2 micro-B USB connection whilst pushbutton, SW1 is pressed.
 3. Drag and drop CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDAv2 application file to the OpenSDAv2 mass storage device.
 4. Unplug and plug the OpenSDA USB connection.

CMSIS-DAP Note:
 - "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application file is located in folder "OpenSDAv2".
 - For more information on OpenSDAv2, refer to FRDM-K64F user manual.

ULINK2 Note:
 - To use an external debugger, such as J-Link, you may need to disconnect the OpenSDA SWD from the K64.
   To do this on the FRDM-K64F board, cut the shorting trace which connects the pins of jumper holes on
   connectors J8 and J12.
 - For more information on "How to use external debugger", refer to FRDM-K64F user manual.
